## Hi there 👋

Mustafa Egeh is my name.
As a frontend engineer, my goal is to create scalable, high-performing web applications with a focus on frontend architecture and long-term maintainability. I spend a lot of time working with sophisticated React patterns, optimizing rendering and data fetching, and fine-tuning performance in practical products. I like taking ownership of challenging user interface issues, debugging large-scale systems, and creating dependable systems as applications expand.

- 🔭 Right now, I'm designing and refining Next.js and React applications for performance and scalability 
- 🌱. I'm currently honing my skills in frontend system design, rendering optimization, and advanced JavaScript patterns 
- 👯. Large-scale React, Next.js, and performance-critical frontend projects are what I'm looking to work on with others.
